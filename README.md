## Description
The operator will spawn [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) using the
[flyway-docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/flyway/flyway).

See `config/samples` for example CRs.

It is still an early project and I want to further develop some day-2 elements as described in the [backlog](https://github.com/nholuongut/flyway-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement).

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

See [INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md)
